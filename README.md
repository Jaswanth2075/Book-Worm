BookWorm project is a bookstore web application built using the MERN stack.
BookWorm is designed to facilitate library access, where an author/administrator has exclusive rights to modify the library's content or books. Meanwhile, multiple users can browse and access the books provided by the author, ensuring clear role-based functionality and content control.
